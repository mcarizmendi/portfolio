                    <h2>Non-Linear Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project was assigned to us for our Midterm. The instructions were: to create a non-linear narrative made up of at least 10 HTML pages. Each page should contain multiple links to other pages (to maintain non-linearity) they should each contain some form of media as well as text and there should be no more than 1 paragraph of text on each page.
                       </p> 
                       <p>
                        <br>
                    Keeping these instructions in mind, I though of telling this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html" >article,</a> from the New York Times, which I read in a non-linear way when using it to wrap home decor at work and therfore decided to create a web-page where you could do the same. 
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    The creative process was very enjoyable! I came up with the idea of telling the story in a map layout as if you are taking the subway to people's different stories. Since the article took place in NYC I thought using a subway map as a layout was a good idea. I added little realistic animations like the glow effect when you hover over the letters just like how they light-up in the subway.

                          <h2>Final</h2>
                          <p>
                              Our last project of the semester was pretty open-ended. The instructions were to make a website that : should consist of at least 6 individual pages. Your project must include text, media (images, video and or audio), the use of CSS animations and some use of JavaScript/jQuery. All media used must be created by you. 
                             </p> 
                             <br>
                         <p>
                         I knew I wanted to challenge myself to make a website for my photography account. I worked a lot on illustrator and worked more on the animations then I did on html or css. It was a very different way to code a website than what I had done prior in class. I knew I really wanted to incorporate the same identity I had given to my other <a href="https://www.good-times-media.com" >site</a> with the logo and colors. I wanted to incorporte more of the film roll aspect and thought of the idea of creating an image gallery with that effect a roll would have. Luckily I was able to find many tutorials on youtube that helped me create my ideas and even learned that all the projects you make on Adobe Illustraor already can be turned into code that you can later animate on css or javascript by telling that code of illustrations how to move. This is how I was able to make my starting page slide in with the logo.

                                      <p>
                                          Although this wasn't assigned in intro to web; I still wanted to include it in this section. Mostly because it was one of the first times were I felt like a true new media student. In my introduction to sound class with Professor Sara Magenheimer, we were assigned to write a research paper for a sound artists which we would also have to present to the class. While writing the research paper I realized when I would present it I would want to show several examples and outside links. So I thought of creating my presentation into a web-article format and since I was taking intro to web at the same time, I decided to use the skills I was learning to make a website for the research I had done.  
                                         </p>

                                     <p>
                                     I also incorporated a "dub generator" which I created in P5.JS thanks to the skills I learned during Programming for Visual Artists with professor Lee Tusman's! This website showcases my web-coding, programming and sound work all in one project. I also like the research paper I wrote on DUB, King Tubby and how it influenced Reggaeton today- Worth a read if you have time!

        <div>I think this is the only class in my 2 years here at Purchase, where I never missed one single class! Partially due to a big fear that I thought missing one lesson would mean never catching up. Luckily that didn't happen. When registering for this class I thought it was a skill that I would never be able to do. My biggest take away is: a little each day goes a long way. I learned quickly from my mistakes in Programming for Visual Arists; where I would not start my homework until a couple days later which was enough days apart for me to forget what we learned in class and  I would have to take time to re-learn everything. That didn't happen this time around! </div>
        <div> I am very proud of the work I did in Professor Thayer's class. I really tried to understand what was taught each class with the readings, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" >tutorials.</a>  I know all the skills I learned here I will contiune to use in practice for any future projects. I am glad I got this class (which at first seemed daunting) over with. I left with some understanding of web-coding and even with a great interest in wanting to continue to learn and advance in html, css and even maybe java-script one day! </div>
