                        My college journey has been a little different than average, before graduating from High School I didn’t register for college like most people do. I had been stuck in the same school system since kindergarten and it had been an anxiety-inducing experience that I wanted to leave behind. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Luckily my last 3 months of senior year, in 2020, were online so it didn’t feel like a big deal to not go to college. I wasn’t planning to go back to school any time soon, but also didn’t expect four years to fly by. In that time, I learned to work hard, save money, and prioritize my mental health. One year after meeting my therapist and having weekly sessions, I was able to shift my mindset and reduce my fears. These sessions helped me realize that I actually loved learning and could benefit from going to college.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I arrived to Purchase as a 21-year-old, undeclared freshman; still uncertain of what to study, but certain I wanted to continue my education. Despite my earlier experiences with education, I came back with a fresh mindset. I  learned to make my classes fit into my interests, and make the most of every class I take. This is how I was able to find New Media.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My first introduction to the major was in Professor Lee Tusman’s Programming for Visual Artists class. I took it because it would meet my general math credit, but it also sounded interesting. Since I didn’t have any coding experience it was intimidating at first, but I was able to see how I enjoy learning in a creative way. I started applying what I was learning in class, to my life outside; I would see visuals and start thinking of how that could be made in code. This shift has only continued. After taking a Digital Design class, I now see everything in grids; I question why restaurants and stores pick certain fonts, or if they put much thought into them. Since my Introduction to Sound class, I no longer listen to music in the same way. I now try to listen if artists are using sonic landscape in their songs or use glitches to enhance a specific feeling. It has either ruined me or helped me appreciate the world a little bit more.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I began putting classroom concepts into practice in my daily life and in my future projects. In Intro to Sound, I was able to use my coding knowledge from Intro to Web, when I turned a research assignment into a <a href="https://mcarizmendi.github.io/research/index.html" target="_blank">website.</a>I am constantly using everything I have learned in Digital Design, from using grids to make Instagram posts for my current job; to making a graphic in Illustrator before adding it to a Video Art or Web-Design project.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The use of photography and design are a big part of my life outside of school, and once I took Introduction to Digital Photography with Professor Yong Kim, I was able to see a great improvement in my photography skills. I have continued to use these skills I learned to create some of my favorite photographs and proudest works, which I’ve now turned into a fun side project: <a href="https://www.good-times-media.com" target="_blank"> Good Times Media.</a>  Here I mixed my photography and design skills, to create a website and a logo.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another part of my college experience is being able to comfortably represent where I am from. My history and identity, which I once struggled with and hid, is now something that I try to embrace by incorporating into my projects. I moved to the U.S as a 2-year old, have no memories of Mexico and I haven’t been back in over 21 years. I didn’t always have a ‘legal’ status here, and I’m not an American citizen. I sometimes feel like a limbo-citizen, one that doesn’t belong to either side. I get told by some Latinos I’m “too gringa,” yet when I was thirteen and tried to fit in with white American girls, I was made to feel like I didn’t belong there either. From these experiences, my identity was seriously tripped up. It wasn’t until last semester, when I took my first-ever Spanish class, that I understood this experience is worth speaking up about. I took Spanish for Heritage Speakers with Professor Carlos Amado, where for the first time, I created projects and videos in Spanish. I got to practice my Spanish and become better, but most importantly I got to speak about the Latinx experience in the U.S with other classmates, which helped me turn shared experiences and feelings into creativity. This new voice that I found has helped me create for myself and others. It is another reason I created Good-Times Media, as well as other projects, like my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/4318767349/protest-poster" target="_blank" >Advocacy poster.</a>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before arriving to Purchase I had never heard of New Media, and now with each semester that goes by, I continue to gain more appreciation for it as both an art and a communication form. Almost all my classes have encouraged us to go to museums and see art, since my first semester: I went to the Neuberger, to write a visual analysis for my College-Writing class and later practiced yoga there on my last day of Vinyasa class! I went to El Museo del Barrio in East Harlem for Intro to Digital Photography and to the MET for Intro to Digital Design to get inspiration for a project. For Intro to Sound, I visited the Whitney and the MoMa museums; and so far into this semester I’ve already gone to the MoMa PS1’s Printed Matter Arts Book Fair, thanks to Professor Magenheimer recommending it. An equally important part of learning for me, has been experiencing art in person. Seeing examples of New Media at museums has given me inspiration for my class work and an appreciation for this major.  

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of my favorite take-aways, which might not mean a lot in terms of New Media, but that I will take seriously and continue to apply in my own life are: when Professor Magenheimer started her semester by telling students that “we are all artist,” even if we just pretend for her class; and Professor Lambert who had us work on a side assignment, where we learned about the 3 Paths Life Exercise, and got to develop our own.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reflecting on my work that has gotten me here today to apply for advanced standing, I can only feel grateful for every positive experience I’ve had since deciding to come back to school. I came to Purchase with very little confidence in my abilities to be a student again, and now almost two years in, I have developed a completely new way of being a student. It isn’t only from the skills that I have been taught, but how I have been able to appreciate and utilize what is taught into my life, outside of school. I believe studying in the New Media program is an important and meaningful influence on my growth as a student, an artist and as an adult.

                        <p>
                            Growing up, I always envisioned myself working in the film industry. I think it came from being exposed to cameras at a young age. But I’ve yet to figure out exactly where I would fit best; I have always enjoyed learning how to make things by hand, but have also developed a love for creating things digitally. When I learned about the New Media major and how it dives into every field of media, I knew it would allow me to explore all of my interests. For my remaining years here at Purchase, I plan to strengthen both my digital and non-digital art skills, while I continue to find my voice as an activist and as an artist.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In order for me to make the most of my college experience, I hope to use all the resources this institution has to offer. A couple of semesters ago, I toured the CMFT building and got to see the 3D-printers, laser and wood shop in the basement. I plan to take advantage of the traditional art forms taught in the following classes: Intro to Printmaking, Camera to Darkroom, Material Distribution, and Digital Design & Fabrication. With my interest in films, I’ve considered working in either the costume or the set design departments. A course that would prepare me for these roles would be Concepts in Costuming & Costume Design and Scene Design. Although they aren’t part of the New Media major, I believe these skills could come in handy when telling a story either in photography or video art.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I also want to keep learning about the history of activism and incorporate it in my work. My past 2 jobs have been at non-profits, which I specifically chose to work for due to ethical reasons and because one day I want to run my own non-profit. Some other classes that I plan on taking before graduating to help me with this goal are: Cultural Activism in Latin America, Cross-Cultural Video Production, Artistic Activism Workshop and The Arts for Social Change. In my Spanish class, Professor Amado mentioned another class called Historia, Memoria e Identidad: The Latinx Experience Through Storytelling taught by Professor Benmergui, which is part of the VOCES Project: Oral Histories and Spanish for Heritage Speakers. The stories shared will become part of a growing digital archive hosted by the Purchase College Library. I plan to combine my New Media skills and Spanish proficiency to be able to share and advocate for others. Overall, I plan to take more classes about media studies and history of art such as LA Art in Age of Globalization, Mexican Art: Revolution-NAFTA, History of Recorded Music and Media & Migration; again to further my knowledge about the topics that interest me. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Currently I am in contact with the Rye Arts Center and hope to start an internship with them next spring. This is another non-profit organization, where I would get to work with local artists/curators, and put my New Media skills to use by helping them with their social media. I would also like to intern in the film or entertainment industry as a Production Assistant for a production company, to explore the different roles involved, which would allow me to have a better idea for the jobs to pursue after graduation.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although I don’t exactly know what my senior project will be, an idea I’ve had for a while is to recreate my final Programming for Visual Artists class project, into a real life installation. For that project, I used a song called Pressure In My Palms by Amine, and layered images of retro T.V. 's with coded Perlin noise to create a short <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mariaarizm10/full/nmN-5lwf0" target="_blank">visual</a> of the topics being rapped about in the song. Possibly difficult to create, but one that I thought about since I made it digitally. My plan would be to find real televisions, and somehow put into them the code I created. The song also mentions, as the title says - Pressure - which I think alone can be another interesting photography project. My idea is to photograph how different races and genders deal with pressure or what gives them pressure. It would be cool to take something I created my first semester and expand on it in my senior year.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Learning the digital principles that I have thus far, I now have a foundation of skills that I will use in my future classes. In my future studies I want to mix medias and incorporate physical with digital whenever possible. I also plan on becoming more educated in how activism can be used effectively in an artistic way so that I can help others in the future.
